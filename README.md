PORTFOLIO This repository contains my personal portfolio website created as part of the beginner-level task in the Web Development program. The website includes sections like About Me, Skills, Projects, and Contact. It is built using HTML and CSS, with optional use of JavaScript for interactivity. The site is responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices. Through this task, I have learned how to structure web pages, apply styling, and deploy a website using GitHub Pages. This portfolio showcases my work and serves as a platform for others to know more about me and my skills.
